            Robots have fascinated us through sci-fi movies for a long time such
            as irobot and more recently Ex Machina.Today we see robots being
            employed in homes(Roomba) and factories.However,with the advent of
            social robots in market such as NAO, PEPPER and AIBO, the
            applications of robotics in the field of Human Computer Interaction
            is seeing the day of light.This can be seen with use of robots in
            homes as companion pets(AIBO).
          </p>
          <p class="robots-have-fascinated">
            While social robots are currently used as companion bots using
            features like playing interactive games and scheduling appointments,

          <p class="we-devised-to">
            We devised to design a companion robot for children undergoing
            painful or long medical procedures as a way to provide comfort to
